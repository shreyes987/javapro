<P><FONT color=white size=4><B>The building blocks of a circuit are called gates. There are 
at least three types of gates:<BR>an AND gate, OR gate, and NOT gate. A NOT gate 
is also called an INVERTER.<BR>When these gates are properly connected, it 
creates a logical circuit.<BR><BR>The top and bottom input values determine the 
state of the input. For<BR>example if an input is 1, then current flows through 
the input line. If<BR>the input is 0 then there is no current through the input 
line.<BR><BR><BR>To illustrate how a logic gate operates, the examples below 
refer to a light switch. <BR>When a light switch is down, no current flows 
through the line, thus keeping the <BR>light off. However if the light switch is 
flipped up, a current flows through the <BR>line to turn the light on.
