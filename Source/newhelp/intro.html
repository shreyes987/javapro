<p><font size="+2">I</font>T IS POSSIBLE IN THEORY to construct a computer
entirely out of transistors (although in practice, other types of basic
components are also used).  Of course, in the process of assembling a computer,
individual transistors are first assembled into relatively simple
circuits, which are then assembled into more complex circuits, and so
on.  The first step in this process is to build <font color="#ff6633">logic gates</font>,
which are circuits that compute basic logical operations such as <font color="#ff6633">AND</font>,
<font color="#ff6633">OR</font>, and <font color="#ff6633">NOT</font>.
In fact, once AND, OR, and NOT gates are available, a 
computer could be assembled entirely from such gates.
In this software you will work with simulated circuits made up of AND, OR and
NOT gates.  You will be able to build such circuits and see how they
operate.  And you will see how simpler circuits can be combined to
produce more complex circuits.</p>


This showed how circuits can be built to perform arithmetic and logical
computations with binary numbers.  Such computations are one of the major functions of
computers.




<p><font size="+2">T</font>HIS CONTINUES THE STUDY OF CIRCUITS built from
logic gates.
  But computers also need at least two other abilities.  They
need <font color="#ff6633">memory</font> --  the ability to store and
retrieve data.  And they need <font color="#ff6633">control</font> -- the
ability to control what data is stored where, which computations are 
performed, and in what order.  A program specifies a series of computations
to be performed by a computer; the computer stores program and data in its
memory, and the computer executes the program under its own control, without any 
further direction from its user or programmer.  You already have some
idea how circuits can perform computations.  In this part, you'll
see how logic gates can be used to build <font color="#ff6633">memory circuits</font>
that can store binary numbers (which are used to represent both programs and data).
As for control functions, they can also be implemented with gates and wires.
