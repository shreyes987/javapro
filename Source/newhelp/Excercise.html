<p><font color=#ff6633><b>Exercise 1:</b></font>  One of the examples in this
lab was the circuit corresponding to the expression</p>
<p align=center>(A <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> B)) <b>or</b> (B <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> A)).</p>
<p>This circuit is ON if <b>exactly one</b> of its inputs is on.  Another way
to describe the output is to say that it is ON if &quot;one or the other
of the inputs is on, but not both of the inputs are on.&quot; This description
corresponds to the Boolean expression</p>
<p align=center>(A <b>or</b> B) <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> ((A <b>and</b> B)).</p>

<p>Build a circuit corresponding to the second expression, and check that
it gives the same output as the first circuit for every possible combination
of inputs.</p>


<p><font color=#ff6633><b>Exercise 2:</b></font>
When you checked &quot;every possible combination of inputs&quot; for
the circuit in Exercise 1, how many combinations did you have to check?
If you wanted to check that the &quot;Two or More&quot; example circuit
works correctly for every possible combination of inputs, how many combinations
would you have to check? Why?  If you wanted to check that the 
&quot;4-Bit Adder&quot; gives the correct answer for each possible set of inputs,
how many inputs are there to check?  Why?</p>


<p><font color=#ff6633><b>Exercise 3:</b></font>Consider the following
three Boolean algebra expressions:</p>

<p align=center>
(A <B>and</B> B <B>and</B> C) <B>or</B> (<B>not</B> B)
</p>
<p align=center>
(<B>not</B> ((<B>not</B> A) <B>and</B> (<B>not</B> B)))
<p align=center>
(<B>not</B> (A <B>or</B> B)) <B>or</B> (A <B>and</B> B)
</p>

<p>For each expression, build a logic circuit that computes the value of
that expression.  Write a paragraph that explains the method that you
apply when you build circuits from expressions.  (One note:  To build a circuit
for an expression of the form (X <b>and</b> Y <b>and</b> Z), you should insert
some extra parentheses, which don't change the answer.  Think of the
expression as ((X <b>and</b> Y) <b>and</b> Z), and build the circuit using two
AND gates.)</p>

<p><font color=#ff6633><b>Exercise 4:</b></font>
Given a logic circuit that does not contain any feedback loops, it
is possible to find a Boolean algebra expression that describes each 
output of that circuit.  Open the circuit called &quot;For Ex. 4&quot;,
which was one of the sample circuits in the applet's pallette.
This circuit has four inputs and three outputs.  Assuming that the inputs
are called A, B, C, and D, find the expression that corresponds to each
of the three outputs.  Also write a paragraph that discusses the
procedure that you apply to find the Boolean expression for the
output of a circuit.</p>


<p><font color=#ff6633><b>Exercise 5:</b></font>
Consider the following input/output table for a circuit with two inputs and
one output.  The table gives the desired output of the circuit for each
possible combination of inputs.</p>


<center>
<TABLE border=1>

<TR align=center>
	<TD><B>&nbsp;Input 1&nbsp;</B></TD>	<TD><B>&nbsp;Input 2&nbsp;</B></TD>	
	                                <TD><B>&nbsp;Output&nbsp;</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR align=center>
	<TD>ON</TD>	<TD>ON</TD>	<TD>ON</TD>
</TR>
<TR align=center>
	<TD>ON</TD>	<TD>OFF</TD>	<TD>ON</TD>
</TR>
<TR align=center>
	<TD>OFF</TD>	<TD>ON</TD>	<TD>OFF</TD>
</TR>
<TR align=center>
	<TD>OFF</TD>	<TD>OFF</TD>	<TD>ON</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</center>

<p>Construct a circuit that displays the specified behavior.  You have to 
build <b>one</b> circuit that satisfies <b>all four</b> rows of the table.
Section 2.1 of <cite>The Most Complex Machines</cite> gives a general 
method for constructing a circuit specified by an input/output table.
You can apply that method, or you can just try to reason logically about
what the table says.  Write a paragraph discussing how you found your
circuit.</p>


<p><font color=#ff6633><b>Exercise 6:</b></font>
One of the examples in this lab was a circuit called &quot;Two or More&quot;,
which checks whether at least two of its inputs are on.  Consider the
problem of finding a similar circuit with four inputs.  The output should
be on if any two (or more) of the inputs are on.  A circuit that does
this can be described by the Boolean expression:</p>

<p align=center>(A <B>and</B> (B <B>or</B> C <B>or</B> D))
<B>or</B> (B <B>and</B> (C <B>or</B> D))
<B>or</B> (C <B>and</B> D)</p>

<p>Use this expression to construct a &quot;Two or More&quot;
circuit with four inputs.  Try to understand where this expression comes
from.  Why does it make sense?  (Hint: Think of two cases, one case where
the input A is ON, and the other case where the input A is OFF.)
Write a paragraph explaining this.  The form of this expression
can be extended to handle circuits with any number of inputs.
Write down a logical expression that describes a circuit with <b>five</b>
inputs that turns on its output whenever two or more of the inputs are on.
