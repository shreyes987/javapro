<p>You've seen that a circuit that does not have any feedback loops
simply takes the values from its inputs and computes an output value
based on those inputs.  Changing the values on the input wires will
change the output values -- after just a very short delay for the signal
to pass through the circuit.  Such circuits have no &quot;memory.&quot;
The output is computed based on the current inputs, and anything that
happened to the circuit in the <b>past</b> has no effect.</p>

<p>Here we are interested in circuits that have some memory of
what happened to them in the past.  That is, the output of the circuit
is not based solely on the current inputs.  It can also depend on inputs
that were given to the circuit in the past.  Memory circuits include
feedback loops.  A feedback loop occurs when the output from a gate
is connected back to an input of the same gate -- possibly through one
or more other gates.  Such a loop allows <b>previous</b> inputs to
affect <b>current</b> outputs.  This is exactly what we need for
memory circuits.</p>

<p>You should see three sample circuits on the circuit board.  Each of these
is a simple circuit containing a feedback loop.  You should
<b>turn on the power</b> and experiment with these circuits.</p>

<p>The first circuit consists of a NOT gate, with its output connected
back to its input.  What happens to this circuit when you turn on the
power?  This is not what I would call a memory circuit!  It shows that
not every circuit that contains a feedback loop can properly be called
a memory circuit.  (In fact, building memory circuits is a pretty touchy
affair.)  However, even this simple example of a feedback loop turns 
out to be useful and interesting, as you'll see in some of the exercises at
the end of the lab.</p>

<p>The second example on the circuit board is an OR gate whose output
is fed back to one of its inputs:
