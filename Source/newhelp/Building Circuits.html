<p>You can build your own circuits in the <font color="#ff6633">Circuit Designer.</font>  Click on
the &quot;Iconify&quot; button at the bottom of the applet.  This will
put away the &quot;Basic Gates&quot; circuit, by turning it into an icon
on the pallette.  You'll have a clear circuit board to work on.
As an exercise, try to make a copy of the sample circuit shown, which corresponds to the Boolean
expression</p>

<p align=center>(A <b>and</b> C) <b>or</b>
                  (B <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> C)).</p>
                  
<p>To add a component to your circuit, click on the component in the pallette,
hold down the mouse button, and use the mouse to drag the component onto
the circuit board.  Make sure you drag it completely onto the board.  If you
want a gate that is facing in a different direction, you have to rotate the 
gate in the pallette <b>before</b> you drag it onto the circuit board.</p>

<p>Once some components are on the board, you can draw wires between them
using the mouse.  Every wire goes from a <font color="#ff6633">source</font>
to a <font color="#ff6633">destination</font>.  To draw a wire, move the
mouse over the source, click and hold the mouse button, move the mouse
to the destination, and release the button.  You <b>must</b> draw the
wire from source to destination, not the reverse.  If you release the mouse
button when the wire is not over a legal destination, no wire will be drawn.
When there are two possible destinations in one component -- such as the two
inputs of an AND or OR gate -- make sure that you get the wire connected
to the right one.</p>

<p>Circuit Inputs are valid sources for wires.  So are Tacks.  So are
the <b>outputs</b> of gates.  Valid destinations include circuit Outputs,
inputs of gates, and Tacks.  You can draw as many wires as you want
<b>from</b> a source, but you can only draw <b>one</b> wire to a
destination.  (This makes sense because when the circuit is running,
a destination takes its value from the single wire that leads to it.
On the other hand, the value of a source can be sent to any number of
wires that lead from it.)</p>

<p>Once a component is on the board, you can still move it to a new
position, but you have to <b>drag it using the right mouse button</b>.
Alternatively -- if you have a one-button mouse, for example -- you can
drag a component by <b>holding down the control key</b> as you first press
the mouse button on it.</p>

<p>You can <b>delete</b> components and wires that you've added by mistake.
Just click on the component or wire to <font color="#ff6633">hilite</font> it.
Then click on the &quot;Delete&quot; button at the bottom of the applet.
The hilited item will be deleted from the circuit board.  If you delete
a component that has wires attached, the attached wires will also be deleted
along with the component.</p>

<p>If you delete an item or modify the circuit in some other way, you get
one chance to change your mind.  You can click on the &quot;Undo&quot;
button to undo one operation.  Only the most recent operation can be
undone in this way.</p>

<p>There is one shortcut that you might find useful, if you like using Tacks.
You can insert a Tack into an existing wire by double-clicking on the wire. If you
double-click and hold the mouse down on the second click, you can drag the tack
to a different position.  (However, some browsers might not support double-clicks.)</p>

<p>After you build the practice circuit, you can clear the screen, since you
won't need that circuit again in the rest of the lab.  However, you'll get
more practice building circuits in the Exercises at the end of the lab.</p>
