<p>In order to have circuits that display <font color="#ff6633">structured complexity</font>,
it is important to be able to build on previous work when designing
new circuits.  Once a circuit has been designed and saved, it should
be possible to use that circuit as a component in a more complex
circuit.  A lot of the power of xLogicCircuits comes from the ability to use
circuits as components in other circuits.  Circuits used in this way are
called <font color="#ff6633">subcircuits</font>.  A circuit that has
been saved as an icon in the pallette can simply be dragged into another
circuit.  (More exactly, a <b>copy</b> of the circuit is created and is
added to the circuit board.  The copy is a separate circuit; editing the original
will not change the copy.)  This ability to build on previous work is
essential for creating complex circuits.</p>

<p>You can open a circuit from the pallette to see what's inside or to edit
it.  Just click on the icon to hilite it, and then click on the &quot;Enlarge&quot;
button.  The icon will be removed from the pallette and the circuit will appear
on the circuit board.  At the same time, any circuit that was previously on
the circuit board will be iconified and placed on the pallette.  
You should also be able to enlarge a circuit just by double-clicking on it.
(By the way, you can change the name of the circuit on the
circuit board by editing the 
text-input box at the top of the applet.  This box contains the name that
appears on the iconified circuit.)</p>

<p>The xLogicCircuits applet should have loaded several subcircuits for the
pallette.  One of these circuits is called &quot;Two or More&quot;.  <b>Open
this circut now.</b>
The circuit has three inputs.  It turns its output ON whenever at least
two of its inputs are ON.  Try it.  (Click on the inputs to turn them ON
and OFF -- and don't forget to turn the Power on first.)</p>
